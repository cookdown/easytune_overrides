## Levels

The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack.  
There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack and is a baseline provided to kick-start your own tuning packs. If you do have a best practice tuning pack to share please reach out to us at <https://github.com/cookdown/easytune_overrides>.  

### DiscoveryOnly

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase

### MPDefault

Contains the SCSM MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.

#### Management Packs Tuned

Microsoft.SystemCenter.ServiceManager.Discovery  
Microsoft.SystemCenter.ServiceManager.Monitoring
