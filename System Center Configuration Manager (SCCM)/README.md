# System Center Service Manager (SCSM) Tuning
This Tuning Pack covers the Microsoft System Configuration Manager (aka SCCM) management pack (captured with version 5.0.8239.1010 of both the Discovery MP and Monitoring MP).

This tuning pack was created by Dave Lewis from team Cookdown.

## Levels
The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack. There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack.

### DiscoveryOnly
Included with every Tuning Pack, discovery only is an excellent way to learn the scope and content of your environment without any alerts or data collection.

### MPDefault
As with the DiscoveryOnly level, MPDefault is included with every Tuning Pack.  This level allows a single group to operate a the pack authors setting, while having the global/class level overrides set to another level.  MPDefault works great with a global level of DiscoveryOnly

#### Management Packs Tuned
Microsoft.SystemCenter2012.ConfigurationManager.Discovery
Microsoft.SystemCenter2012.ConfigurationManager.Monitoring
