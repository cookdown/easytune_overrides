# SQL Server 2012 Tuning

This Tuning Pack covers the Microsoft authored SQL 2012 management packs.

## Tuning Levels

The following tuning levels are included in this pack, if you have additional tuning and updates that would fit well with this tuning we always appreciate community contributions.

### DiscoveryOnly

Included with every Tuning Pack, discovery only is an excellent way to learn the scope and content of your environment without any alerts or data collection.

### MPDefault

As with the DiscoveryOnly level, MPDefault is included with every Tuning Pack.  
This level allows a single group to operate a the pack authors setting, while having the global/class level overrides set to another level.  
MPDefault works great with a global level of DiscoveryOnly
