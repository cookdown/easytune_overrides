### Discovery Only

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase in new tuning.

Contains the MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
