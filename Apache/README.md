# Apache HTTPS Server Librabry Tuning

This Tuning Pack covers the Apache HTTP Server Libraby management pack (captured with version 7.7.1127.0 of the MP).

## Levels

The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack. There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack

### DiscoveryOnly

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase

### MPDefault

Contains the Apache MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.

#### Management Packs Tuned
