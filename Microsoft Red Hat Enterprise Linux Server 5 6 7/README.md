## Levels

The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack. There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack

### DiscoveryOnly

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase

### MPDefault

Contains the RHEL 5, 6,7 and the Redhat common library MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
