## Tuning Levels

The following levels are included in this Tuning Pack and developed in the same style as the SQL agnostic Tuning Pack.

### Discovery Only

Included with every Tuning Pack, discovery only is an excellent way to learn the scope and content of your environment without any alerts or data collection.

### Test

This level presents a very minimal level of monitoring for Test SQL managed instances.  Just enough monitoring to make sure that the instance and databases are running with very infrequent performance collections; 15 minute intervals.

### QA

This level is very similar to Test, but it increases the level of performance metric collection; 10 minute intervals.

### Production

This level has most of the monitors turned on and the performance collections are tuned to the normal 5 minute interval.

### Performance Monitoring

**Enable this with _caution_!!!**  This is similar to the Production tuning level, but all of the performance collections are set to a 2 minute interval.  This is handy when you want more of a real-time view of the system.  Keep in mind that running this profile on more than a few SQL managed instances could have a performance impact for both the managed instance being monitored and your SCOM landscape.
