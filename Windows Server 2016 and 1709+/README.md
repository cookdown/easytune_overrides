This Tuning Pack covers the Microsoft Windows Server 2016+ management packs.  
Microsoft have authored all of the management packs affected by this tuning pack.

## Tuning Levels

The following tuning levels are included in this Tuning Pack.  
There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack.  

### Discovery Only

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase in new tuning.  

### MP Default

Contains the MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
