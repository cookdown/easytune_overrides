## Levels

The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack.

### DiscoveryOnly

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase

### MPDefault

Contains the HYCU MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.

### Minimal

Contains tuning for the LTM pack to turn off some of the availability monitors. All other overrides are the same as the MP defaults (as we had set globally DiscoveryOnly)
